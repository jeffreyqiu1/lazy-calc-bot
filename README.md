It supports the following formulas (for now I'm adding more just wait):

$dot (vector 1 arguments) (vector 2 arguments) returns the dot product of vectors 1 and 2\
$cross (vector 1 arguments) (vector 2 arguments) returns the cross product of vectors 1 and 2 in transpose notation\
$choose (n) (r) is n Choose r\
$pick (n) (r) is n Pick r\
$binompdf (n) (p) (x) is the chance of exactly x successes in n trials with a p chance of success per trial\
$binomcdf (n) (p) (x) is the chance of up to x successes in n trials with a p chance of success per trial\
$nbinompdf (n) (p) (x) is the chance of the xth success happening on the nth trial with a p chance of success per trial
